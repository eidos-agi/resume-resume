Add MCP tools to resume-resume that read from the new summary_levels table in commons:

- `read_project_summary(project_path)` — return L2 summary for a project
- `list_projects(limit, sort_by)` — list projects with session counts and staleness
- `portfolio_view()` — return L3 rollup
- Update `merge_context` to prefer L2 summary over raw session merging when available

These are thin wrappers over commons query functions. The intelligence is in commons; resume-resume just exposes it.

**Archived:** Superseded by TASK-0015 (same scope — wire L2 into MCP — but with tighter DoD, acceptance criteria, and milestone assignment)
