Two-part validation per SOP-004:

1. **Benchmark re-run:** Run the 30 queries from TASK-0012 against L2 summaries. For queries tagged as L2-resolvable, does the project summary answer them without drilling down? Document pass/fail.

2. **Consumer validation:** Cold-start sessions in ciso and director-of-ai. Can the agent read a project summary and be immediately productive? Test: "What's the status of the Wrike renewal?" should be answerable from L2 without searching 5 sessions.

If validation fails, adjust L2 generation before proceeding to L3.

Linked to MS-0001. This is the quality gate — if L2 doesn't pass consumer validation, we fix it before shipping project_orient().
