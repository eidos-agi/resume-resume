Currently crashed sessions with no cached summary show "Last message: <last user msg>". This is better than blank but still weak.

Improve by extracting from the JSONL tail:
- Last assistant message (what was Claude doing when it crashed)
- Last tool call (what file/repo was being touched)
- Session duration and message count (was this a 2-minute or 2-hour session?)

This gives enough context to decide whether a crashed session is worth resuming without having to read_session first.

Deprioritized — project_orient() (TASK-0016) will provide richer context for all sessions including crashed ones. This becomes a nice-to-have polish task after MS-0001 ships.
