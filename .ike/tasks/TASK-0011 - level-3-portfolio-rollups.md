Same pattern as L2, one level up. Feed L2 project summaries to claude -p: "Summarize active projects across this portfolio. What's moving, what's stalled, what needs attention?"

Trigger: daily or on-demand. Store in summary_levels with level=3. This powers cross-project views like "what did I work on this week?" and cockpit dashboards.

Only build after L2 validation passes (TASK-0013).

Correctly gated behind TASK-0013 (L2 validation). Do not start until MS-0001 ships and L2 is validated. L3 is the next milestone, not this one.
