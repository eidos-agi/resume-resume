Capture 30 real queries from actual usage with expected results. For each: the query, expected answer, which sessions contain it, what level should resolve it (L1/L2/L3).

Baseline: run each query against existing RRF search (rrf_search in insights.py) and BM25 (resume-resume search_sessions). Record what works and what fails. This establishes the "before" measurement.

After L2 is built, re-run the same queries. This is the validation loop per SOP-004.

Linked to MS-0001 (Instant Project Context). This benchmark validates whether L2 summaries actually answer the questions users ask. Without it we're shipping blind.
